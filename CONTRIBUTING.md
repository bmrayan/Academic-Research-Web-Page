   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/academic-website.git
   cd academic-website
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:

- **Maintain performance optimizations**:
  - Prefer `transform` over layout-changing properties
  - Use `will-change` appropriately
  - Implement CSS containment where beneficial
- **Ensure responsive design**:
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Test on various screen sizes
  - Maintain two-line navigation on mobile

### JavaScript Standards
- **Keep vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks/libraries)
- **Maintain performance focus**:
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
  - Implement throttling and debouncing
  - Cache DOM queries where possible

  - Event delegation where appropriate
  - Consistent error handling
  - Clear function naming

- **File names**: Lowercase with hyphens

### Comments
- **Add comments for complex logic**
- **Document any performance optimizations**
- **Explain accessibility considerations**
- **Include browser compatibility notes if needed**

### Formatting
- **Use consistent indentation** (2 spaces)
- **Add blank lines for readability**
